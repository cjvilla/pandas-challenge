# pandas-challenge
Analyzed data for a recent fantasy game called Heroes of Pymoli. Generated a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data, gender demographics, top spenders, and most popular items. The Pandas Library and Jupyter Notebook were used as tools for this report. Includes a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
